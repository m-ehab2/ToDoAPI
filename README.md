# ToDoAPI

The Express API, powered by Express.js and MongoDB, ensures secure authentication and role-based access control. With user roles (User, Admin, SuperAdmin), it efficiently manages to-do lists and tasks. The API's structure prioritizes scalability and security for robust task management applications.

## Steps

1. **Setup and Configuration:**

   -  Set up a new Node.js project.
   -  Initialize a package.json file.
   -  Install necessary dependencies (Express, Mongoose, etc.).
   -  Create basic project structure (folders: routes, models, controllers, config, etc.).
   -  Set up a basic Express server in `index.js`.
   -  _Done_

2. **Database Integration:**

   -  Define Mongoose models for Users, Lists, and ToDos.
   -  Implement database connection and configuration (in `database.js`).
   -  _Done_

3. **Authentication and Authorization:**

   -  Implement user registration and login routes.
   -  Integrate password hashing for security.
   -  Set up JWT (JSON Web Token) for user authentication.
   -  Create middleware for role-based access control.

4. **User Management:**

   -  Develop routes for viewing and updating user profiles.
   -  Implement user deletion functionality (for admins).
   -  Add error handling for user-related operations.

5. **List and ToDo Functionality:**

   -  Design and implement routes for managing to-do lists (create, update, delete).
   -  Add routes for managing individual to-dos within a list.
   -  Include error handling and validation for these operations.

6. **Admin and SuperAdmin Features:**

   -  Implement routes for admin functionalities (viewing all users, managing users).
   -  Create routes for SuperAdmin tasks (assigning and revoking admin privileges).
   -  Ensure appropriate permissions and error handling.

7. **Testing:**

   -  Write unit tests for critical functions.
   -  Set up integration tests for API routes.
   -  Ensure test coverage for authentication, authorization, and core functionalities.

8. **Documentation and Comments:**

   -  Document your code, including API endpoints and usage.
   -  Add comments to explain complex logic or critical sections.
   -  Update or create a README file with instructions for running the app locally.

9. **Refinement and Optimization:**

   -  Refactor code for readability and maintainability.
   -  Optimize database queries and indexing for better performance.
   -  Consider security best practices (e.g., rate limiting, CORS headers).

10.   **Deployment:**
      -  Prepare the app for deployment.
      -  Choose a hosting platform (e.g., Heroku, AWS, or others).
      -  Deploy the application and configure environment variables.
